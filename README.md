# Boardgame Stats

This is a small, incomplete demo with purposeful security vulnerabilities to demo various parts of the GitHub Platform. You probably shouldn't use it...

## Usage

```sh
npm install
npm run app.js
```

<!--

## TODO

- Add plays (vuln here)
- Add plays seed data
- Add BGG API data
- Implement frontend
- Implement security vulnerability such as db.all(`SELECT * FROM books WHERE author LIKE '%${author}'`)
- Implement code error - SELECT * FROM non_existent_table
- Implement code error - missing comma between endpoint params
- Create issues for feature implementation (locations, grab more data [images] for frontend, add game comments),
- Create issues for language conversion
- Script out add testing
